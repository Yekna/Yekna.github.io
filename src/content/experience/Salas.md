description: Local messuage storage tracker. Where I first learned how to write good backend code (models, migrations, ORMs, indexing, resolvers, DTOs etc.). Used NestJS because it shares a similar design pattern with Angular and both use Typescript as their primary language so it made the most sense.
stack: [Angular, NestJS, PostgreSQL]
